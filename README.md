### Project Title: **SoulTunes - Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System**

### Project Overview:
Developed a real-time emotion-based music recommendation system using **CNNs** and **OpenCV** for facial emotion detection, providing personalized music playlists.

### Key Features:
1. Integrated **Haar Cascade** and **CNN** for real-time facial emotion recognition, mapping emotions like happiness, sadness, and anger to relevant music.
2. Built a web-based interface using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, allowing users to receive music recommendations based on detected emotions.
3. Developed the system using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras**, training the model on the **Kaggle dataset** for accurate emotion analysis.
4. Integrated the platform with **Spotify**, using the API to stream personalized music based on emotional states.

### Key Challenges:
1. Improved emotion detection accuracy, especially for complex emotions like anger and fear, using advanced **CNN** training.
2. Maintained real-time performance for emotion detection and music recommendations using efficient **OpenCV** processing.
3. Addressed privacy concerns related to facial recognition data by implementing privacy-compliant practices.

### Learning Outcomes:
1. Gained expertise in **CNNs** and **OpenCV** for emotion detection and model training.
2. Enhanced skills in building full-stack applications with a focus on user experience and emotion-based personalization.
3. Overcame technical challenges in linking real-time emotion detection to a dynamic music recommendation system.
