Project Title: Soultunes - Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System

Project Overview:
Developed a real-time music recommendation system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV for facial emotion detection, offering personalized playlists based on emotional states.

Key Features:
Implemented real-time facial emotion detection with Haar Cascade and CNNs, using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV for back-end processing, while the front-end utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated with the Spotify API for music streaming.

Key Challenges:
Faced challenges in achieving high emotion detection accuracy with CNNs, ensuring real-time processing using OpenCV, and managing privacy concerns related to facial recognition data.

Learning Outcomes:
Developed expertise in CNNs, TensorFlow, Keras, and real-time video processing with OpenCV, while successfully integrating a personalized music recommendation system with a Spotify-based interface.

Future Enhancements:
Plan to expand music platform support beyond Spotify, improve accuracy by incorporating multi-modal data such as voice and text, and implement real-time user feedback to enhance recommendations.
